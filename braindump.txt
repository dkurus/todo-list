//ok next is projects....
// every task needs a project property... 
// well first, whats the problem? 
1. clicking a project name should display all the tasks with that project-name property.
2. active project name should display the currently clicked tab
3. newTask button needs a drop-list to select project(state+dom)
4. editTask button needs a drop-list to select project(state+dom)

tasksList
1. lets start with new task adding project to state
2. render project list in desginated area.
3. modifying regenerate task list to show only taskObjs of clicked project
4. edit task

today tast list
1. add event listener to input element oon project list  
- when user hits enter, take input, add it to list
- each list item comes with a delete button and a unique id to target it
- event listener should also update the new Task projects list
- edit task needs to get the form elements for project list (very similar to the one alrady made)
- regenerate tasklist should be modified to show only current project
- default project will be called default and cannot be deleted. all things will go do default if not specified.
