//ok next is projects....
// every task needs a project property... 
// well first, whats the problem? 
1. clicking a project name should display all the tasks with that project-name property.
2. active project name should display the currently clicked tab
3. newTask button needs a drop-list to select project(state+dom)
4. editTask button needs a drop-list to select project(state+dom)

tasksList
1. lets start with new task adding project to state
2. render project list in desginated area.
3. modifying regenerate task list to show only taskObjs of clicked project
4. edit task

today tast list
1. add event listener to input element oon project list  
! when user hits enter, take input, add it to list 
! render and delete list each time new project is added 
! each list item comes with an extra element that lets you delete. that extra element has an data-project with the projects name value.
! write eventlistener that lets you delete project from list, 
! event listener should also update the new Task projects list during adds and deletes
! make it so, default is always the first option in the input selection
    - hmm, default should have a slightly different behavior than the others. 
    - firstly it won't come with a delete button...
    - secondly it will always be the first option ...
    - to implement this.. we might have to make a seperate thing for it.
    - it won't exist in the project list. or it could on initial load. i just need to add an exception on the loop that renders the delete buttons. 
! state needs to reflect the new form elements in new task 
    - priority
    - project
- edit task form needs to create the project and priority list as well
- edit task needs to get the form elements for project list (very similar to the one alrady made)
- regenerate tasklist should be modified to show only current project
- default project will be called default and cannot be deleted. all things will go do default if not specified. 


for later
- delete project button should delete its containing tasks
